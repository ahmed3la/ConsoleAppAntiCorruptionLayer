# Anti-Corruption Layer Example

This example demonstrates how to implement an Anti-Corruption Layer in C# to facilitate communication and data translation between two modules with different interfaces. The code includes a BillingModule, an AccountingModule, and an Anti-Corruption Layer.

## Project Structure

- `BillingModule`: Simulates a module responsible for billing operations.
- `AccountingModule`: Simulates a module responsible for accounting and financial operations.
- `AntiCorruptionLayer`: Acts as an intermediary to enable communication between BillingModule and AccountingModule.

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (version 5.0 or higher)
- C# development environment

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.

2. Open the solution in your preferred C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code).

3. Build and run the application to see how the Anti-Corruption Layer facilitates communication between BillingModule and AccountingModule.

## Usage

1. Define the interfaces for the BillingModule and AccountingModule in their respective modules.
2. Implement the Anti-Corruption Layer to translate data and method calls between modules with differing interfaces.
3. Use the Anti-Corruption Layer in the main program to facilitate communication between modules.
